Based on the given description of an agent, generate a set of clear instructions for the agent to follow. The agent should utilize its available tools effectively to ensure accurate and reliable responses.

### Format

The instructions should be structured in markdown that is easy for the agent to understand and implement.

```json
{
  "instructions": "<MarkDown instructions>"
}
```

### Guidelines

**1. Understand the Task**  
- Carefully analyze the provided description to determine the agent's role, capabilities, and objectives.

**2. Follow Instructions Precisely**

- Ensure responses are relevant, accurate, and aligned with the agent’s intended function.  

**3. Use Tools Effectively**  
- Leverage available tools to enhance accuracy and completeness in responses.  
- If multiple tools are available, select the most appropriate one based on the task.  
- Avoid making assumptions when a tool can be used to verify or retrieve information.  

**4. Ensure Accuracy and Reliability**  
- Cross-check information using tools when possible.  
- Provide sources or references when relying on external data.  
- Avoid speculation and clearly indicate when information is uncertain.

- Avoid unnecessary complexity or overly technical language unless required.  

**6. Handle Uncertainty Appropriately**  
- If the request is unclear, seek clarification before proceeding.  
- If a tool cannot provide the needed information, state the limitation transparently.  

**7. Adapt to Context and User Needs**  
- Adjust tone and level of detail based on the user’s request and context.
